                <p>
                    LJLutils is a Java Class Library that is supposed to help developers developing faster by having
                    methods
                    like visualizing tree-structures in the console by automatically indenting them and so on. It will
                    be
                    continually extended as there are more things developed by the author, which he thinks are worthy of
                    putting into this library.
                </p>
                <h2>Topics already adressed by this library:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Console Printing</li>
                    <li>Physics and Vector Calculations (WIP)</li>
                </ul>
