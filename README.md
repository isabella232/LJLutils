# JavaUtils

JavaUtils is a Java Class Library that is supposed to help developers developing faster by having methods like visualizing tree-structures in the console by automatically indenting them and so on.
It will be continually extended as there are more things developed by the author, which he thinks are worthy of putting into this library.

Now, I wish you luck working with this library.
