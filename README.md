# PKutils

![Stable: Not version released yet](https://img.shields.io/badge/stable%20version-not%20released%20yet-red.svg)

PKutils is a Java Class Library that is supposed to help developers developing faster by having methods like visualizing tree-structures in the console by automatically indenting them and so on.
It will be continually extended as there are more things developed by the author, which he thinks are worthy of putting into this library.

## Topics already adressed by this library:
- Console Printing
- Physics and Vector Calculations (WIP)

Now, I wish you success working with this library.
```Java
public class Quote {
    public void EinsteinOnceSaid() {
        System.out.println("Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler");
    }
}
```
